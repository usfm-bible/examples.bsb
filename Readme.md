# Berean Standard Bible

This is not the official release of the Berean Standard Bible. It is a fork of
the text as of 26/Aug/2024. This is a sympathetic fork in that the licensing
remains the same and there is no intention to deviate any textual content.

The purpose of this project is to 'fix' the USFM markup of the BSB to use as an
example of one way of marking up a bible in USFM 3.1. The markup has been chosen
to conform to the typesetting style of the BSB print Bible.
